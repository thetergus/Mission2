Learning Topics:      HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Mission Brief: 
In order to successfully hone your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills we ask you to design and create a one-page personal website.   

This mission will demonstrate your comprehension and understanding relating to the various practices and languages shared during the first three weeks of the course.  

Content-wise, the personal web page can be whatever you want to it to be. Anything from a professional looking business page to a site about penguins, just remember the mission is to demonstrate coding abilities/practices so if you are struggling on the design & content of things, KEEP IT SIMPLE. If you are struggling for a place to start, feel free to create a personal portfolio page or turn your CV into a web page (most likely when you apply for a job they’re going to want to see your work, what better way to show them than with a web page).  

This mission is for practice purposes.  It is NOT part of an assessment for NZQA qualification.
